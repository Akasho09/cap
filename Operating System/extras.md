| Step            | Mode   | What Happens       |
| --------------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| Click play      | User   | App receives input |
| Open file       | Kernel | Disk access        |

## How ls Command Works (User Mode ↔ Kernel Mode Flow)
```yml
User types "ls"
     ↓
Shell (User Mode)
     ↓ fork()
Kernel creates process
     ↓ exec()
Kernel loads ls
     ↓
ls runs (User Mode)
     ↓
System calls (open, read, write)
     ↓
Kernel accesses filesystem

## Cache , RAM , ROM
| Memory Type           | Location          | Speed                              | Volatile |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------- |
| **TLB**               | Inside CPU (MMU)  | 🚀 **Fastest**(1-128kb)            | Yes      |
| **Cache (L1/L2/L3)**  | Inside / near CPU | 🔥 Very Fast                       | Yes      |
| **RAM (Main Memory)** | Motherboard       | ⚡ Fast                             | Yes      |
| **ROM**               | Motherboard       | 🐢 Slow                            | No       |
| **Hard Disk / SSD**   | Storage Device    | 🐌 Slowest *(SSD faster than HDD)* | No       |

- in MAC's
| Component | Size Range    | Location                 |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| Cache     | ~20–30 MB     | Inside CPU               |
| RAM       | 8–16 GB       | On-chip (Unified Memory) |
| ROM       | ~16–32 MB     | On motherboard           |
| SSD       | 256 GB – 2 TB | Internal storage         |

## MultiLevel Cache :
| Cache Level | Speed   | Size       | Location        | Shared?   |
| ----------- | ------- | ---------- | --------------- | --------- |
| L1          | Fastest | Very Small | Inside CPU core | ❌         |
| L2          | Fast    | Medium     | Inside CPU      | Sometimes |
| L3          | Slower  | Large      | Shared on chip  | ✅         |


## Buffering 
- is a technique used by the operating system to temporarily store data in memory (buffer) while it is being transferred between two devices or processes that operate at different speeds.


## Spooling (Simultaneous Peripheral Operations On-Line)
Spooling is a technique used by the operating system to store I/O data temporarily on disk so that slow I/O devices (like printers) can work independently of faster processes (like the CPU).

| Feature          | Spooling         | Buffering      |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| Storage location | Disk             | Memory (RAM)   |
| Used for         | Slow I/O devices | Speed mismatch |
| Example          | Printer queue    | Keyboard input |
| Data size        | Large            | Small          |

## 🔁 IPC – Inter-Process Communication
- Inter-Process Communication (IPC) is a mechanism that allows processes to communicate and share data with each other while executing concurrently in an operating system.
- EXAMPLE :
1. Shared Memory:
    - A .jpg to tiff converter (p1) is in kernel mode and p2, which will send the address of the image to p1 is in user mode.
    - to solve this we use shared memory ipc .
    - p2 writes the string addreess to shared space , with some $(for example) to shared space and then p1 reads from it.(idk yehi hai)

2. Message Passing:
    - Processes communicate via message passing
    - Messages stored in a queue with type and data

### 🧠 Why IPC is Needed
- Processes run in separate memory spaces
- They cannot directly access each other’s data
- IPC enables:
    - Data sharing
    - Synchronization
    - Coordination between processes

## Virtualization
Virtualization is a technology that allows one physical machine to run multiple virtual machines (VMs), each behaving like an independent computer with its own OS, memory, and CPU.

## TO COVER 
 spin locking  , live locking , busy waiting , best process scheduling algo , 


## Cache hit 
- occurs when the data requested by the CPU is found in the cache memory, so it can be accessed quickly without going to main memory (RAM).
- In simple terms:
- 👉 Requested data = already in cache → Cache Hit
- Why it matters:
    - Much faster access (nanoseconds vs milliseconds)
    - Improves system performance
    - Reduces CPU waiting time
- Example:
- If the CPU needs variable x and it's already stored in cache → cache hit
- If not found and it must fetch from RAM → cache miss
- Types of Cache Hits:
    - L1 Cache Hit – fastest
    - L2 Cache Hit
    - L3 Cache Hit – slower than L1/L2 but faster than RAM
- Cache Hit Ratio:
Hit Ratio = Number of cache hits / Total memory accesses
- Higher hit ratio = better performance ✅

## 🧠 What is TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer)?
- TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) is a small, **fast cache** inside the CPU that stores recently used page table entries to speed up virtual-to-physical address translation.

### 🔍 Why TLB is Needed
- When a program accesses memory:
    - CPU generates a virtual address
    - OS must translate it to a physical address using the page table
    - Accessing page table in RAM is slow
- ➡️ TLB solves this by storing recent translations so the CPU can skip accessing the page table.

## Livelock
- A livelock occurs when two or more processes keep responding to each other but make no actual progress.
- EXAMPLE : 
- IN DINING PHILOSPHER PROB :
    - assume 2 philospher only .
    - IF A PHILOSPHER1 IS USING FORK1 n needs fork2 also n p2 is using fork2 needs f1 . we have used a policy that philospher will use fork only if both are free. so p1 will free f1 and p2 will free p2 . now p1 will take f2 and p2 will take f1 and LOOPP WILL OCCOUR.

## Little Endian vs Big Endian
- Endianness?
     - Endianness defines how **multi-byte data** (like int, float) is stored in memory.
     - 👉 It tells us which byte goes first in memory.

- In Little Endian, the least significant byte (LSB) is stored at the lowest memory address.
     - example :
     - 0x12345678
     | Byte   | Value |
     | ------ | ----- |
     | Byte 0 | 78    |
     | Byte 1 | 56    |
     | Byte 2 | 34    |
     | Byte 3 | 12    |


- In Big Endian, the most significant byte (MSB) is stored at the lowest memory address.
- 
          | Address | Data |
          | ------- | ---- |
          | 1000    | 12   |
          | 1001    | 34   |
          | 1002    | 56   |
          | 1003    | 78   |


## Schedulers

| Scheduler   | Function                   |*Frequency*| Controls                   |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------- |
| Long-Term   | Admits jobs                | Low       | Degree of multiprogramming |
| Short-Term  | Chooses next process       | Very High | CPU time                   |
| Medium-Term | Suspends/resumes processes | Medium    | Memory usage               |


## Queues

| Queue Name      | Contains               | Managed By            |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Job Queue       | All new processes      | Long-term scheduler   |
| Ready Queue     | Ready-to-run processes | Short-term scheduler  |
| Waiting Queue   | Waiting for I/O        | OS                    |
| Device Queue    | Waiting for devices    | Device controller     |
| Suspended Queue | Swapped-out processes  | Medium-term scheduler |

## Idle Process
- CPU Idle Task (Kernel Idle Process)
     - Runs when the ready queue is empty
     - Often executes a simple infinite loop
     - Puts CPU into low-power mode
- 📌 Example:
- Linux: idle / swapper
- Windows: System Idle Process

> Exists so the scheduler always has something to schedule
