- Hooks allow functions to have access to state and other React features without using classes.
- They provide a more direct API to React concepts like props, state, context, refs, and lifecycle.
> Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from functional components.

## useRef :
- The useRef Hook allows you to persist values between renders.
- It can be used to store a mutable value that does not cause a re-render when updated.
- It can be used to access a DOM element directly.
